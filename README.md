# Overview

This site was built using MongoDB Atlas, Express, React, and Node JS. It is a shopping-like site wherein users can freely
browse products, add them to their cart, and check them out. They can also view their transactions (pending and cancelled) and they can also edit their profile on their profile page. Each transaction and each item in the shopping cart were stored in a database that utilizes MongoDB Atlas. It also uses JSON Web Token (JWT) for handling authentication and it also uses Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). It also uses Multer for image upload (from local storage to localhost and database).
For the admin (merchant) side, it has dashboard that shows the most recent orders, the number of foods, users, and total sales. It can add, view, and delete a product and increase its quantity. It can manage and delete users, and also confirm and reject pending orders made by users. This also has report of the sold products for the whole week, month, year, or all-time.
